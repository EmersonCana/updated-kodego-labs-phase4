# Client-Side Routing Exercise

## Objective

The objective of this exercise is to gain practical experience with client-side routing in React using React Router. It covers the basics of client-side routing, setting up routing in a React application, working with BrowserRouter, Routes, Route components, creating links between routes, handling URL parameters, and implementing nested routes.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with React fundamentals.

## Task

1. **Introduction to Client-Side Routing**

   - Create a new React project using Vite.
   - Install React Router in your project using npm or yarn.
   - Research and understand the concept of client-side routing and its benefits in single-page applications.

2. **React Router**

   - Set up client-side routing in your React application using React Router.
   - Configure basic routing for your application.

3. **BrowserRouter**

   - Implement BrowserRouter in your application to enable client-side routing.
   - Ensure that the BrowserRouter component wraps your entire application.

4. **Routes**

   - Define routes for different pages or components in your application.
   - Use the Routes component to specify the routes and their corresponding components.

5. **Route**

   - Use the Route component to define individual routes within the Routes component.
   - Specify the path and component props for each Route.

6. **Link**

   - Implement navigation between routes using the Link component.
   - Create links to different routes within your application.

7. **URL Parameters**

   - Create a route that accepts URL parameters, such as a dynamic route for displaying user profiles.
   - Extract and use URL parameters in your component to customize the content based on the URL.

8. **Nested Routes**
   - Implement nested routes by nesting Route components within each other.
   - Create a parent route that renders a layout component, and define child routes within it for different sections of the layout.

## Task Details

- Implement each task in a separate file or component within your React project.
- Test each route and navigation link to ensure they work correctly.
- You can use placeholder components or real components for each route, depending on your project structure.
- Feel free to use additional features of React Router if needed, such as route guards or route transitions.

## Submission

- After completing the exercise, submit your React project containing all the implemented routing functionality.
- Provide comments or documentation within your code to explain the purpose of each route and how it works.
