# React Components Exercise

## Objective

The objective of this exercise is to gain practical experience with React components, focusing on understanding the basics of components, the differences between functional and class-based components, organizing code with import/export, writing JSX, and conditional rendering using Vite.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with React fundamentals.

## Task

1. **React Component Basics**

   - Set up a new React project using Vite.
   - Create a simple functional component named `HelloWorld` that renders a `<div>` containing the text "Hello, World!".
   - Use this component in the main `App` component and render it to the DOM.

2. **Functional vs Class-based Components**

   - Create both a functional and a class-based component for a simple counter.
   - The counter component should display a count value and two buttons: one to increment the count and one to decrement it.
   - Implement the functionality to increment and decrement the count in both components.
   - Compare and contrast the syntax and behavior of functional and class-based components.

3. **Organizing Code with Import/Export**

   - Create two separate components: `Header` and `Footer`.
   - Export these components from separate files and import them into the main `App` component.
   - Render both the `Header` and `Footer` components in the `App` component.

4. **Writing JSX**

   - Create a component named `Greeting` that takes a `name` prop and renders a personalized greeting message.
   - Use this component in the `App` component with different `name` props to display different greetings.

5. **Conditional Rendering**
   - Create a component named `UserStatus` that takes a `isLoggedIn` prop.
   - If `isLoggedIn` is true, the component should render a welcome message, otherwise, it should render a login prompt.
   - Use this component in the `App` component, passing different values for the `isLoggedIn` prop to see different render outputs.

## Task Details

- Implement each task in a separate file or component within your React project.
- Test each component to ensure it functions as expected.
- Feel free to use additional libraries or tools if needed.

## Submission

- After completing the exercise, submit your React project containing all the implemented components and functionalities.
- Provide comments or documentation within your code to explain the purpose of each component and how it works.
