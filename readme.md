# Portfolio Project 4 (Phase 4) - Build a React frontend application with fetched data from API

## Learning Goals

- Build a React single page application from scratch
- Apply knowledge of components, props, and state management
- Incorporate client-side routing
- Use data from an API

## Introduction

Now that you’ve learned the fundamentals of React, it’s time to practice and expand your skills by making a React project from scratch.

## Requirements

- You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.
- Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.
- There should be at least 3 client-side routes using React Router. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI elements that allow users to navigate between routes.
- Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
- Add some styling: you’re encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled components or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like React Bootstrap, Semantic UI, or Material UI).
